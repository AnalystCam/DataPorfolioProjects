Assessing the dataset

SELECT * 
FROM 'students.csv';

Finding the total number of Domestic and international students

SELECT inter_dom, COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM 'students.csv'
WHERE inter_dom IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY inter_dom

Finding the total of all records per student 

SELECT COUNT(inter_dom) AS count_inter_dom
FROM 'students.csv'

Finding the number of international students and their average scores 

SELECT stay, COUNT(*) AS count_int, ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as
FROM 'students.csv'
WHERE stay IS NOT NULL
AND inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay DESC

Results: 

Based on the analysis, the result shows that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

Recommendation:

This analysis provides valuable insights into the mental health challenges faced by international students, shedding light on two significant factors: social connectedness and acculturative stress. By identifying these predictors of depression, the study offers a crucial foundation for developing targeted interventions and support systems tailored to the unique needs of international students.

It is important to acknowledge that international students are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health difficulties due to acculturative stress. Therefore, universities and communities must prioritize initiatives that promote cultural understanding, facilitate social connections, and provide comprehensive mental health support services for these students.

By fostering inclusive environments and implementing proactive measures, we can enhance social integration and mitigate the impact of acculturative stress on international students' mental health. Overall, this recommendation serves as a call to action, emphasizing the significance of addressing the mental health needs of international students and fostering an environment where they feel valued, supported, and empowered to thrive academically and personally.
